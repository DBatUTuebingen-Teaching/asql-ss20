        <h2>Sets</h2>
        <p>The <strong>AllSets.json</strong> file is an object that looks like this:</p>

        <p>A flat array of all sets is also available: <a href="https://mtgjson.com/json/AllSetsArray.json">AllSetsArray.json</a> and <a href="https://mtgjson.com/json/AllSetsArray-x.json">AllSetsArray-x.json</a></p>
        <p>Each individual set is a JSON object like this:</p>

  "LEB" : { /* set data */ },

        <p>Each individual set is a JSON object like this:</p>
        <pre><code data-language="javascript">{
  "name" : "Nemesis",            // The name of the set

        <p>Some software (Magic Workstation) uses non-standard set codes. You can find those <a href="http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=581#p6454">in this post</a></p>
      </div>
      <div><a name="booster"></a>
        <h2>Booster Field</h2>
        <p>The 'booster' key is present for each set that has physical 
boosters (so not present for box sets, duel decks, digital masters 
editions, etc.). It is an array containing one item per card in the 
booster. Thus the array length is how many cards are in a booster. Each 
item in the array is either a string representing the type of booster 
card or an array of strings representing possible types for that booster
 card.</p>
        <p>For example, 'Magic 2013' contains 1 land, 1 marketing card, 10 commons, 3 uncommons and 1 rare or mythic rare:</p>
        <pre><code data-language="javascript">{
  "name" : "Magic 2013",
  "booster" : [ "land", "marketing", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "common", "uncommon", "uncommon", "uncommon", [ "rare", "mythic rare" ] ]
}</code></pre>
        <p>The common booster card types are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>common</li>
          <li>uncommon</li>
          <li>rare</li>
          <li>mythic rare</li>
          <li>land</li>
          <li>marketing</li>
          <li>checklist</li>
          <li>double faced</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Time Spiral block has some additional types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>timeshifted common</li>
          <li>timeshifted uncommon</li>
          <li>timeshifted rare</li>
          <li>timeshifted purple</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that the 'Time Spiral "Timeshifted"' set does not have a 
booster field. This 'set' was actually a subset of the 'Time Spiral' set
 and its cards are the 'timeshifted purple' booster card type mentioned 
above.
          The "Magic: The Gathering—Conspiracy" expansion has an 
additional "draft-matters" type which can either be a "Conspiracy" type 
card or a card that affects drafting.
          The "Vintage Masters" set has one slot that can contain either
 a power nine card or a guaranteed foil, so it has additional types 
"power nine" and "foil".
          Foils are not explictily mentioned, except for 'Modern 
Masters' where a slot is guaranteed a foil. So that set has four 
additional possible booster card types: foil common, foil uncommon, foil
 rare and foil mythic rare.
          Any card marked as "starter" : true should be exempted from 
any booster generation as these cards were only available in boxed sets 
and not in boosters.

        <h2>Cards</h2>
        <p>
          The cards value is an Array of cards, each being a JSON object
 with key/value pairs. Below you will find a table detailing each key.
          The cards are ordered first by 'number', then by 'name', then 
by 'multiverseid'.
          If a value would be empty (such as manaCost for Basic Lands), 
then the key will not exist in the object.
          All cards are from the latest Oracle text, not the original 
printed text (the 'extras' file has the originalText which is the 
non-oracle text).

        <h2>AllCards.json</h2>
        <p>The <strong>AllCards.json</strong> file is organized by card name and merges card data from multiple sets into a single card object.<br><br>
      Due to this merging of card data, several set specific fields are 
not present in the AllCards data: artist, border, flavor, foreignNames, 
id, mciNumber, multiverseid, number, originalText, originalType, rarity,
 releaseDate, reserved, timeshifted, variations, watermark<br><br>      This file is lighter weight and is meant to provide a quick and easy way to get basic card data.<br><br>      The JSON file itself looks like this:<br></p>
        <pre><code data-language="javascript">{
...
"Nevinyrral's Disk" : { /* card data */ },
           "Norrit" : { /* card data */ },
"Nullmage Shepherd" : { /* card data */ },
...
}</code></pre>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Additional JSON Files</h2>
        <p>Several additional JSON files are available and will be updated whenever card data is added or updated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://mtgjson.com/json/SetCodes.json">/json/SetCodes.json</a> - An array of set codes currently available</li>
          <li><a href="https://mtgjson.com/json/SetList.json">/json/SetList.json</a> - An array of sets (code, name and releaseDate) currently available</li>
          <li><a href="https://mtgjson.com/json/version.json">/json/version.json</a> - Current version number as a quoted string</li>
          <li><a href="https://mtgjson.com/json/version-full.json">/json/version-full.json</a> - Current version number as a JSON object</li>
          <li><a href="https://mtgjson.com/json/changelog.json">/json/changelog.json</a> - Lists all changes in JSON format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It also notes which JSON files have changed since the last update with fields: updatedSetFiles, newSetFiles, removedSetFiles</p>
      </div>
      <div><a name="jsonp"></a>
        <h2>JSONP</h2>
        <p>
          All JSON files are also available as JSONP files by changing the extension from '.json' to '.jsonp'.
          This allows you to include them client side by linking to them directly with a <script> tag.
        </p>
        <p>HTML Example: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://mtgjson.com/json/AllSets.jsonp"></script></p>
        <p>
          A callback handler called 'mtgjsoncallback' will be called with 2 arguments.
          The first argument is the JSON data itself. This isn't a string, so no need to call JSON.parse()
          The second is the file name as a string, without an extension ("AllSets" in the example).
        </p>
        <p>Client side javascript example:</p>
        <pre><code data-language="javascript">window.mtgjsoncallback = function(data, name) {
  /* handling code here */
};</code></pre>
