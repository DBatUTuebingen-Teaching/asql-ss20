-- âš  This variant implements K-Means using recursive UNION set semantics,
--   based on
--
--  âžŠ a user-defined equality operator: = :: point Ã— point â†’ bool
--    (and aggregate AVG :: bag(point) â†’ point)
\i points.sql

--  âž‹ a custom integer type 'iter' (to count iterations) ALL OF
--     WHOSE VALUES COMPARE EQUAL and thus do not affect recursion
--     termination
\i iter.sql


-- Set of points P that we will cluster
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS points;
CREATE TABLE points (
  point  int   GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTIY,   -- unique point ID/label
  loc    point                                -- location of point in 2D space
);

-- Instantiate P
INSERT INTO points(loc) VALUES
   (point(1.0, 1.0)),
   (point(2.0, 1.5)),
   (point(4.0, 3.0)),

-- K-Means using set semantics (UNION), this version finds the fixpoint
-- of the iterated K-Means computation and does not assume a predetermined
-- number of iterations.
--
-- NB.
--  - column "iter" is of user-definewd type iter (see ðŸ µ below ) whose
--    values always compare equal (and thus do not affect recursion termination)
--  - we rely on type point being comparable (required for set-based UNION)
--  - we make use of a user-defined AVG aggregate on type point (see ðŸ · below)
